## R env

For the R environment, we use the `renv` package to manage dependencies. 
This is a short how-to.
Renv install the necessary packages in a local library, so you do not need to install them globally.
Renv stores version of the pacakges in the a renv.lock file. This ensures easy reproducibility of the environment.

```R
renv::init()
```
initialisates the necessary files and settings. It will automatically look into your R files to see if there are packages that need to be installed or not


```R
renv::install()
```
Is used for installing the packages.


```R
renv::restore()
```
To restore a previous enviornment.

```R
renv::refresh()
```
To update all the packages.
